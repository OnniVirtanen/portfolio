                <p>
                    I am currently studying a Bachelor's degree of ICT in Finland.
                    I believe that my ability to think critically and solve problems 
                    efficiently is one of my key strengths, and I am drawn to entrepreneurship.
                </p>

                    In my free time, I take pleasure in engaging in outdoor activities such
                    as hiking and exploring nature. 
                    I also have a keen interest in programming and computer science, 
                    which I regularly practice to improve my skills.
